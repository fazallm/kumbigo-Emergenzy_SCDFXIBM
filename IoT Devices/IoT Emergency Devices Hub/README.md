### Description

In order to understand the emergency situation better among elderly and other population and allow faster respond to handle the stituation we create Wearable Emergency Band. This band will use arduino nano ble sense as the hearth of the band. This arduino have 9 axis inertial sensor and barometric sensor to detect sudden drop of altitude indicating the user have fall from standing. It also have microphone, light led, light intensity to know the current situation of the user in case of emergency. In addition to that, this emergency band will detect if user have cardiac arrest by detect the hearth pulse of the user using heart pulse sensor.

This Wearable Emergenzy Band will communicate to user phone using the improved my responder app using bluetooth signal
