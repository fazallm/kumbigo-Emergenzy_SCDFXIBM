# Emergenzy
Preventive Analytical Tools with Emergency Trigger System

## 1. Summary, Situational Analysis and Key issues

### 1.1 Summary
- SCDF X IBM Lifesaver challenge communities to code for good.
	- Solution driven with innovation creativity as emphasis

- CFR partner to provide help.
- Leverage analytics and technology to increase survival probability
	- Especially to elderly with no next of kin

- Mitigate the issue, we devise an analytical tools complemented with
	emergency trigger system which is easy to operate, reliable and resilient.
	- Make us of analytics as a preventive measure
	- Relies on IoT and user input to improve emergency detection
	- Add several features which improve current app

### 1.2 Situational Analysis
	- Increase of aging population
	- Existence of CFR to assist emergency 
	- myResponder is an app available to bridge community and CFR

### 1.3 Key Issues
	- Require active action at 3 point of communication to utilize CFR
		- Elderly is not tech-savvy
		- Officer need to manually write detail which is error-prone
	- Info limitation to identify victim

## 2. Strategy and Recommendations

### 2.1 Devise analytical tools

### 2.2 Devise an emergency trigger system
	- Consist of trigger device which would sent
	- Installed at home
	- Device active if
		button is pressed
		Fall detection is activated
		When triggered, send info to server

### 2.3 Improve existing myResponder app
	- Monitoring/alarming when activated
	- CFR info to give assurance to triggerer
	- Physical info of triggerer for easier identification


## 3. Implementation and Plan of Action

### 3.1 Survey
### 3.2 Data collection
### 3.3 Device fabrication
### 3.4 Software development
### 3.5 Deployment and Adoption
### 3.6 Iteration


## 4. Conclusion 
To conclude, Emergenzyl could provide efficient deployment of CFR through Preventive measure of Emergenzyl! analytics and better sense-making from Emergenzyl! bracelet and improved myResponder
