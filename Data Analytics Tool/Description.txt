In this section, Risk Factor (RF) for each planning area in Singapore is calculated.

The data was taken from Singapore Department of Statistics which contains: numbers of population in planning areas grouped by their age group (etc. 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, etc.)
RF is calculated based on the following formulas:

the number of elderly people (above 60 years old) / the number of non-elderly people who are capable to help (15-59 years old)

The underlying principle of this calculation is because on most of the case, young people tend to act more quickly to notification and therefore on general would provide help faster.
